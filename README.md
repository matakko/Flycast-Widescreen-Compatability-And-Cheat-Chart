# Flycast Master Widescreen Compatibility and Cheat Chart

## Overview

Welcome to the most comprehensive resource available for Flycast emulator widescreen and 60 FPS codes. This repository contains detailed compatibility charts for Dreamcast, Atomiswave, Naomi 1 & 2, and System SP games. Whether you're looking to enhance your retro gaming experience with widescreen support or smoother framerates, you'll find everything you need here.

Each game entry includes information for all available regions, as codes often differ between regional releases. This makes it easy to find the exact codes you need for your specific game version.

## Chart Structure

Each chart includes the following information:
- **Game Name**: The title of the game
- **Region**: NA (North America), EU (Europe), JP (Japan), etc.
- **Native Widescreen**: Whether the game supports widescreen natively
- **Widescreen Hack**: If widescreen can be enabled via emulator hacks
- **Widescreen Cheat**: Status of widescreen cheat compatibility
- **Codes/Notes**: The actual Codebreaker format cheat codes and any additional information

## Status Legend

- **Perfect**: Widescreen functions flawlessly with no visual issues
- **Clipping**: Widescreen works but shows texture pop-in/pop-out at the edges
- **None**: No widescreen support available
- **???**: Not tested or status unknown

## How to Use These Codes

Depending on the type of widescreen support, follow one of these methods:

### For Native Widescreen:
1. Enable widescreen in the game's options menu
2. Set Horizontal Stretching to 133% in Flycast GFX settings

### For Widescreen Hack:
1. Go to Flycast GFX settings
2. Turn on the "Widescreen" option

### For Widescreen Cheats:
1. First try enabling "Widescreen Cheats" in the Flycast GFX settings page
2. If that doesn't work (codes not in Flycast database):
   - Go to the Cheats page in the Flycast Quick menu
   - Click "ADD cheats"
   - Type or paste the codes (CTRL+V works to paste)
   - Give it a name like "Widescreen"
   - Each line will auto-save
   - Make sure to enable each cheat box that's created (one box per code in format "XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX")

## Contributing

If you've tested a game not listed here or found different results for existing entries, please consider contributing! You can submit a pull request or open an issue with your findings. It is VERY easy. You simply change the ??? block to one of the 3 answers: Perfect, Clipping, or None. Everything "Native" SHOULD be done, but anything with ??? means it has not been found. Testing takes seconds. Ensure if you are using cheats, you reload the scene if nothing seems to change. Some games require a fresh load, so going to the main menu then going back into the game is enough in most cases. NOTE: MENUS TEND TO NOT CHANGE EVEN IF THE CODE WORKS, so make sure you test IN-GAME PLAY ONLY.
